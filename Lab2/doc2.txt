SymbolTable:
- BST structure for symbol table;
- contains head, of type Node;
    Node contains:
        value, of type String;
        index, of type int;
        left, right of type Node;
    methods: int getIndex(String value)
            verifies whether Node exists with given value;
            whenever value does not exist, adds Node, then returns index of new Node;
            whenever value does exist, return index of existing Node;
        - args: value = identifier to be stored
        - returns: index at which value was stored (or had been previously stored)

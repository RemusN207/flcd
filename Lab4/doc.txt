finite automaton model which:
    -provides a cli for:
        -displaying info about the automaton
        -checking if a sequence is accepted by the automaton (DFA only)
    -read automaton info from file:
        -input must follow specification:
            input = stateDef initialDef alphabetDef transitionDef finalDef
            stateDef = "state" stateList
